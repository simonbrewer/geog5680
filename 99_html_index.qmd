# Introduction

Over the past few years, the R programming language has become increasingly widespread in academia and industry for statistical analysis, bioinformatics, data mining and graphics. This increase in its use means that many people have encountered it through journals, websites, coursework and colleagues, but may have little training in the basics of the language and are unaware of the full set of possible applications. 

This course is designed to give an intensive introduction to R as a programming language and as a graphical tool. We will also cover some basic analysis, although the focus will largely be on the language itself. It is aimed at people with little to no prior experience with R or programming, although some basic knowledge of statistics is assumed.
